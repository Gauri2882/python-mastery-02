# Python Intermediate Notebooks

## 1. `09_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì Dictionaries
**Concepts:**
- Accessing/modifying dictionary values
- Adding/removing entries
- Looping with `.items()`
- Checking key existence (`in` keyword)

**Project: Contact Book**
- Menu-driven CLI app to add, view, edit, search, and delete contacts.
- Uses nested dictionaries for contact storage.

## 2. `10_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì Tuples & Sets
**Concepts:**
- Tuple immutability and unpacking
- Set operations: Union (`|`), Intersection (`&`), Difference (`-`)
- Adding/removing set elements

**Project: Ingredient Checker**
- Compares recipe ingredients with user-input ingredients.
- Identifies missing/extra ingredients using set differences.

## 3. `11_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì File Handling
**Concepts:**
- File modes: Read (`r`), Write (`w`), Append (`a`)
- Context managers (`with` block)
- Handling `FileNotFoundError`

**Project: Note-Taking App**
- Saves, views, and deletes notes in `notes.txt`.
- Uses file append/write/read operations.

## 4. `12_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì Exception Handling
**Concepts:**
- `try-except-else-finally` blocks
- Handling multiple exceptions (e.g., `ValueError`, `ZeroDivisionError`)
- Raising custom exceptions (`raise ValueError`)

**Project: Safe Calculator**
- Performs arithmetic operations with input validation.
- Prevents crashes on invalid inputs/divisions by zero.

## 5. `13_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì Functions with Return Values
**Concepts:**
- Single vs. multiple return values
- Returning calculations (e.g., area of a rectangle)
- Best practices for clean returns

**Project: Temperature Converter**
- Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
- Uses 6 dedicated conversion functions with rounded outputs.

## 6. `14_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì List Comprehensions
**Concepts:**
- Basic syntax: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]`
- Filtering: `[x for x in list if x % 2 == 0]`
- Conditional logic: `["Even" if x%2==0 else "Odd" for x in numbers]`

**Project: Student Grade Manager**
- Assigns grades (A-F) based on scores using list comprehensions.
- Filters passing/failing scores into separate lists.

## 7. `15_python_intermediate.ipynb` ‚Äì Modules & Libraries
**Concepts:**
- Importing built-in modules (`math`, `random`, `string`)
- Creating/using custom modules (e.g., `greetings.py`)
- Aliasing imports (`import random as r`)

**Project: Random Password Generator**
- Generates secure passwords with uppercase, lowercase, digits, and symbols.
- Uses `random.choices()` and enforces minimum length.
